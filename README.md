# Revenue and Demand Forecasting Analysis

This end-to-end data analysis project explores whether increasing prices next year is feasible for a bike-sharing service. It follows the complete lifecycle of data analysis, including database creation, SQL query development, Power BI dashboard creation, and actionable insights.

### Project Workflow:

1. **Build a Database:**
   * Import raw data from Excel into SQL Server.
   * Create and join tables using SQL to clean and structure the data.
     
     Explore the dataset [here](https://github.com/Gaelim/YT_bike_share).

2. **Develop SQL Queries:**
   * Combine datasets from 2021 and 2022 using UNION and build a consolidated table for analysis.
   * Calculate key metrics such as revenue, profit, and profit margin with SQL expressions.
     
     View SQL script [here](https://github.com/soumya-thoutam/Revenue-and-Demand-Forecasting-Analysis/blob/main/Revenue_and_Demand_Forecasting_Analysis.sql).

3. **Connect Power BI to the Database:**
   * Import the consolidated table into Power BI.
   * Use both import and direct query modes for efficient data handling.

4. **Build a Dashboard:**
   * Design an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring visuals for key performance indicators (KPIs).
   * Include features like revenue by season, hourly trends, and rider demographics.
     
     Access the Power BI dashboard [here](https://github.com/soumya-thoutam/Revenue-and-Demand-Forecasting-Analysis/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20End-to-End%20Project.pbix).

5. **Make Analysis Recommendations:**
   * Conduct price elasticity analysis to evaluate the feasibility of increasing prices next year.
   * Suggested a conservative price increase of 10-15% based on data insights.

### Key Features:

* #### Tools & Technologies:
    * **Database:** SQL Server
    * **Visualization:** Power BI
    * **Languages:** SQL

* #### Dashboard Components:
    * Seasonal Revenue Trends
    * Hourly Revenue and Profit Analysis
    * Rider Demographics (Registered vs. Casual)
    * KPIs: Total Revenue, Profit, and Riders

### Actionable Insights:

* A 25% price increase in 2022 led to a 64% rise in demand, showcasing strong customer interest despite higher prices.
* Recommended a conservative price increase of 10-15% to sustain demand and maximize profitability.

### **Dashboard Visualization**
Here is a visual representation of the final Power BI Dashboard that showcases key performance indicators and actionable insights from the analysis:
